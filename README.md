# üìÑ Abstract
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning in dynamic 3D environments is a highly complex optimization problem due to the presence of obstacles and operational constraints. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Quantum-Inspired Adaptive Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (QIAEDA), a novel and innovative approach that combines quantum principles with Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) to enhance both search space exploration and exploitation. QIAEDA introduces two key enhancements: (1) a time-decayed, stagnation-aware regularization factor that adaptively controls the covariance structure to balance exploration and exploitation; and (2) a quantum-inspired rotation-based variation operator that introduces controlled directional diversity without disrupting solution feasibility. These components are seamlessly integrated into the probabilistic model framework, enabling the algorithm to adapt effectively to dynamic changes in the environment. QIAEDA incorporates quantum operators to significantly improve convergence speed and adaptability, making it exceptionally effective in solving high-dimensional and computationally demanding path planning problems. Its performance is comprehensively evaluated through extensive simulations conducted in various real-life-inspired dynamic environments and benchmarked against several state-of-the-art algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm for Continuous Domains (UMDAc), Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). The results demonstrate QIAEDA‚Äôs superior ability to consistently generate high-quality UAV paths with significantly lower standard deviations, ensuring more reliable and robust performance. Statistical analysis performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test further validates QIAEDA‚Äôs substantial advantage, with the algorithm outperforming all other methods in the majority of test cases across multiple scenarios.
